## Getting Started

To use this pricing component in your project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```ruby
   git clone https://github.com/anilmaurya61/easybank-landing-page
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```ruby
    cd easybank-landing-page
    ```
3. Open the index.html file using a tool like "Live Server" to start a local development server:

    - If you don't have "Live Server" installed, you can install it using an extension in your code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
    - Once installed, right-click on index.html and select "Open with Live Server." This will    open the HTML file in your default web browser, and any changes you make to the project files will automatically trigger a live update.
